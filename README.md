Gym Scheduling System - Overview
The Gym Scheduling System is designed to manage and streamline class scheduling for gyms, focusing on three primary user roles: Admin, Trainer, and Trainee. This system allows gym administrators to efficiently manage trainers, their class schedules, and trainee bookings, ensuring that classes are conducted smoothly and without conflicts.

The Admin plays a crucial role in the system, responsible for creating and managing trainers. They assign available dates and times for each trainer's classes, ensuring that no trainer exceeds the maximum of 5 classes per day, with each class lasting 2 hours. The admin also monitors the capacity of each class, trainee attendance, and overall system functionality. They have full control over the system and can oversee all activities, ensuring that trainers are properly scheduled and trainees are assigned to classes without any conflicts.

The Trainer, while having a limited role, can view their assigned classes via their dashboard. They can see important details such as the dates, times, and duration of each class, as well as the maximum capacity of trainees per class. Trainers can also view a list of trainees who have enrolled in their classes and the current number of trainees booked. However, they do not have the ability to modify their availability or make any changes to their schedule. Their role is focused on teaching and managing the trainees assigned to them.

The Trainee uses the system to browse available classes and book sessions based on the trainersâ€™ schedules. They can only book classes that have available slots and must avoid any booking conflicts, ensuring that no two classes overlap in their schedule. Trainees can also update their personal profiles and manage their bookings through a dedicated dashboard. This dashboard allows them to view their upcoming and past bookings, as well as reschedule or cancel classes if necessary, provided there are no conflicts with other booked classes.

In essence, the Gym Scheduling System is designed to provide a seamless scheduling experience, ensuring efficient class management for admins, clear visibility for trainers, and flexible booking options for trainees, all while preventing scheduling conflicts and managing class capacities.
